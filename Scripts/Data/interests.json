            "description": "Since the rest of my CV is dedicated to programming I wont go into much detail here but, currently as a hobby, i am creating my own small game in Unity called \"A Town for Cattle\" which i plan to release on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation and Steam. It will be a relatively small game, but focus on Zelda-like gameplay and a simple yet tightly written storyline with optional environmentally told side-stories for each of the characters."

            "description": "I used to create Electronic music under the name of Toxik. I created it for around 8 years of my life and have been signed under multiple record deals. I used the software called Ableton to create the music, and my music was inspired by a mixture of dark pop, orchestral and traditional middle-eastern music, combining each of these disparate styles into the incredibly adaptable genres of DnB and Dubstep."

            "description": "Gaming has been a part of my life ever since i could move my hands. With Metroid Fusion being the first game i ever played back on my GameBoy Advance SP, i have been enthralled by the storytelling possibilities that interactive medium brings. I mostly play indie games, since they often are the ones to push the boundaries of video ame storytelling, however i also enjoy some AAA games too. Amongst my favourite games of all time are Undertale, Hollow Knight, Metroid Dread, Portal and Hades."

            "description": "I enjoy watching many different kinds of films and TV show and discussing the aftermath and the meaning of them. I enjoy films and shows that are more thought-provoking and take on a deeper meaning than what they might first seem, such as Puss n Boots: The last wish, Godzilla Minus One and Megamind. I also enjoy films that are more light-hearted and fun, such as older Marvel movies, Jo-jo Rabbit and... Megamind again."
